    <h3>KEY BREASTFEEDING FACTS</h3>
    <p id="facts">The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that infants be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months
      with continued breastfeeding while introducing appropriate complementary foods for 1 year or longer. <a href="https://www.factsaboutfertility.org/">Key factors</a>. Although most infants receive some breastmilk, most
      are not exclusively breastfeeding or continuing to breastfeed as long as recommended.</p>

    <h3>Positioning</h3>
    <p>There are many different ways to nurse your little one. Make sure to do what is comfortable for you and baby. Just
      a few to name, are the cross or cradle hold, kaola hold, side laying position etc. Just make sure comfort is top
      priority. </p>

    <h3>Working Mom</h3>
    <p>Alot of people give up on nursing due to working full time. The key to keeping the milk supply while working is to
      NEVER forget about expressing your milk. Purchasing a breast pump is very beneficial for this purpose. Remember, the
      more you express, the more your milk will flow. Milk can be stored for future use at the proper recommendation in
      the freezer or refrigerator.</p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>The biggest benefit is protecting you and your baby from different cancers. One of my favorite benefits is the
      bonding that you will have. My motto is, (if possible), "Why pay for milk when you can get the cow for free?"</p>

    <h3>How Do You Prepare</h3>
    <p>Knowledge is Power. Breastfeeding is portrayed in a society as some kind of idyllic, easy and miraculous for babies
      and moms. </p>
    <p>
      Take a breastfeeding class and have your breast examined. </p>
    <p>Create a comfortable place to breastfeed baby. Stock up on breastfeeding esentials. Most importantly, do not be
      ashamed or afraid to ask for help.</p>

    <h3>Consistency is key</h3>
    <p>If we are to support the culture of breastfeeding, consistency is key. We cannot tell a mother that breastfeeding
      is crucial, but shame her when she does it in public. </p>
    <p>
      Do we expect all breastfeeding mothers to stay at home or remain invisible, simply because some people happen to
      feel ‘offended’ by the sight of breast? </p>
    <p>All mothers – breastfeeding or otherwise – go through long and overwhelming battles. Being patronised about ‘the
      right way’ to feed their child or ‘how much they can expose while breastfeeding is the last thing they need.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 class="love">Live</h2>
    <p>Live for the present and the future. Forget about the past. Beastfeed that baby to make the nourishment last.</p>

    <h3>Breastfeed</h3>
    <p>Breastfeed today, tomorrow and forever. Get the knowledge and power for yourself and the future.</p>


    <h3>Breastfeeding vs. Bottle Feeding</h3>
    <p>Breastmilk is a living fluid. It adapts to your baby's changing circumstances. If your baby gets ill, your body
      makes extra white blood cells and antibobies that travel into your milk to help fight infection. Formuls milk is
      made of processed skimmed cow's milk with added emlsifiers and stabilizers to help the oils and water mix when you
      make up the feed.</p>

    <h3>Discomfort</h3>
    <p>Discomfort and pain, which are not uncommon, especially during the first two weeks. Some mothers also struggle with
      painful mastitis or thrush. Although these are disadvantages, none of it is permanent. The pain is only temporary.
      There are products available for yout comfort.</p>

      <p>It’s also normal for breast milk to appear in a range of colors from slightly yellow to yellow-orange and even green.</p>
      <p>The color of your breast milk can change based on what you eat, drink and the medications you take while breastfeeding.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>NEVER:</h3>        
      <p>You never want to keep milk at temperatures higher than 77 F (25 C) because of the risk of bacteria growth.</p>
      <p>Once your milk has been frozen and thawed, you also never want to refreeze your milk.</p>
