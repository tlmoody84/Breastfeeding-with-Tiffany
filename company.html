    <h2 id="name">Founder Tiffany Sharpe</h2>
    <p>Mother of five breastfed children. Breastfeeding is definitely my passion. Bonding with my children was such a
      special time while nursing. I enjoyed every moment. Just a little bit of encoragement can go a long way.</p>
    <p>I created my company once I gave birth to my 2nd child Niko, who was experiencing a lot of difficulty latching.
      He had silent reflux which made it a really challenging postpartum experience. I had very little guidance around
      lactation. I wasn’t getting any sleep. I felt exhausted and desperate having no knowledge of where to go for
      support.</p>
    <p>This is why I decided to create a company where no woman has to struggle with the lack of knowledge from nursing.
    </p>
    <p>My personal purpose is to support as many mothers and babies as we can around the world. My promise to you is
      that we will always be here, and we will do everything that we can to help support and care for you and your baby.
      Tiffany~</p>
